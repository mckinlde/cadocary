The value generated by any piece of automation is a relatively simple calculation:

(human hours saved)*(hourly rate of human) = (value generated by software)
a.k.a.
(hrs)*($/hr)=($)

That said, there can be much quibbling over the precise values of (human hours saved), and many clients are unsatisfied with paying software the same hourly rate as they would pay a human.

In practice, projects can be billed in one of two ways:
1. An agreed upon amount of $ for the creation of an agreed upon specification.
2. An agreed upon rate of $/hr for time spent working in pursuit of an agreed upon result.

In case (1), the primary risk to the Client is that they overpay for a project that the Consultant can easily achieve.  The primary risk to the Consultant is that they [underestimate the difficulty of delivering](https://xkcd.com/1319/) the Client's specification.

In case (2), the primary risk to the Client is that they accumulate sunk cost on a Consultant that is ultimately incapable of delivering the result.  The primary risk to the Consultant is that they are unable to arbitrage their expertise.  ($1 to hit it, $100 to know where)

Computer Automation development is ultimately an arbitrage of time between a Software Engineer and some other White-Collar Worker.  The hope is that (hrs*$/hr)^Software Engineer < (hrs*$/hr)^Other Worker; a.k.a. that the value generated by the software exceeds the cost of it's development.

The chart above is honestly a great rule of thumb, especially because it compares return on Time, instead of return on $.  For example, an 8-12% return on $ can be achieved by not purchased any software, and instead simply buying the S&P.  It remains to be examined whether that produces a return on Time for the investor.
