Cadocary builds one-off software projects to automate tasks that humans hate

Whether you're a public defender sick of manually creating folders for each client, or a rocket manufacturer trying to comply with state reporting requirements, Cadocary can take your most hated chore and turn it into your favorite button.

Most hated chores follow a similar structure, something like:
- open a web portal, spreadsheet, or series of documents
- do some trivial task based on it
- over and over again

The economics of these projects are remarkably simple.  All we need to know is:
- How long does the task take
- How often does it need to be done
- What are the steps

From there, we can calculate how much it costs you per year to [perform the task], and if we think we can build a [perform the task] button for less, we'll gladly build it for you!

It helps if you have a budget for the project in mind, but don't worry if not--if there's a way to remove mindless toil from the world, it's almost always worth doing.
